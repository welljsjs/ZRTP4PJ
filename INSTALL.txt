How to use ZRTP4PJ
===================================================

This is how the file tree structure looks like:

ZRTP4PJ
|----build/
|----example/
|----lib/ (may not exist or be empty, that's totally fine)
|----zsrtp/
|----Makefile
|----README.md
|----ZRTP4PJ.xcodeproj
|----INSTALL.txt

You need to take the following steps in order to use ZRTP within PJSIP:

1. Ensure that the latest version of SRTP is loaded; execute './zsrtp/getzrtp.sh'.

You need to move/copy the following folders:

2. Copy the content of the 'build' directory (another dir called 'zsrtp') to 'pjsip/third_party/build/'. That's how pjsip knows what third-party libraries it needs to build.
3. Copy the 'zsrtp' directory to 'pjsip/third_party/'. That's where the sources for the build are located.
